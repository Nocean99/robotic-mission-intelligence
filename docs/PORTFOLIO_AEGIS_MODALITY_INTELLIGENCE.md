# Aegis Modality Intelligence Portfolio Note

## Summary

Aegis Mission Intelligence now supports modality-aware benchmark interpretation for vehicle search. The benchmark results show that RGB and infrared imagery should not use the same review policy.

## Vehicle Benchmark Results

| Modality | Strategy | Images | Capture Precision | Capture Recall | Capture F1 |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| RGB | local vehicle proposals | 500 | 50.0% | 100.0% | 66.7% |
| RGB | API semantic review | 100 | 73.2% | 95.3% | 82.8% |
| Infrared | local hot-blob triage | 500 | 89.4% | 100.0% | 94.4% |
| Infrared | API semantic review | 100 | 61.1% | 100.0% | 75.9% |

## Interpretation

RGB vehicle evidence benefits from selective API semantic review. The local RGB proposal layer is useful because it preserves likely evidence, but it creates a noisy analyst queue. API review improves capture precision while keeping recall high.

Infrared vehicle evidence currently performs better with local hot-blob triage. The API preserved recall, but it treated too many ambiguous thermal negatives as reviewable evidence. Thermal API review needs stricter prompting or stricter NEEDS_REVIEW thresholds before it improves the IR workflow.

## Product Lesson

The benchmark result supports a key Aegis design principle: mission review policy should depend on sensor modality.

A single mission can combine multiple intelligence layers:

- Aegis Vision Intelligence for RGB imagery
- Aegis Infrared Intelligence for thermal imagery
- Aegis Acoustic Intelligence for sonar, audio, and other signal-based sensing

The next logical expansion is an acoustic/sonar module that can evaluate non-visual evidence with the same mission-memory and benchmark discipline.
